=== PLAYER 0 TURN ===
PROMPT:
You are Player 0 in a cooperative Hanabi game.

RULES:

        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        

GAME STATE:
- Score: 0/25
- Deck Remaining: 40 cards
- Hint Tokens: 8/8


STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. SAFETY FIRST: Never play a card unless you're certain it's playable
2. INFORMATION: Give hints that provide maximum useful information
3. EFFICIENCY: Only discard when necessary (low on hints) or when certain a card is useless
4. CRITICAL CARDS: Be extremely careful with 5s and unique cards visible in teammates' hands

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
- If you have certain knowledge a card is playable → PLAY it
- If hints available and teammate has playable card → Give helpful HINT
- If hints needed and you're certain a card is useless → DISCARD it
- Otherwise → Give a hint or discard safest card (oldest/leftmost with least info)

RULE: If you choose PLAY or DISCARD, "slot" MUST be one of the valid slots shown.
RULE: If you choose a hint, "teammate" MUST be one of: {teammate_a}, {teammate_b}.
If you choose anything invalid, you lose the game.

SAFE DISCARD HEURISTIC:
- If any of your cards are guaranteed dead → discard the leftmost dead card.
- If none dead: discard your oldest card that is most likely unplayable
  (slot with the largest number of remaining possibilities).
- NEVER discard a 5 unless it is confirmed dead.

==================================================

=== PLAYER 0 TURN ===
PROMPT:
You are Player 0 in a cooperative Hanabi game.

RULES:

        - The game uses a 50-card deck, divided into five colours (red (R), green (G), blue (B), yellow (Y), white (W)). Each color has cards of ranks 1 to 5. Each color has with three 1's, two 2's, two 3's, two 4's, one 5.
        - Players have to create stacks of each color. Each color stack starts with a Rank 1 card and goes up one by one in ascending order up to Rank 5.  (e.g. Red Stack should go from R1 -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 -> R5). A card can only be played if it is the next in the incremental sequence for its color stack.
        - Players can only see the other's hand, not their own.
        - Players have plausible knowledge of their cards based on previously provided hints by the other player
        - They can either play a card, give a reveal, or discard a card.
        ***Actions:***
                1. Reveal (Clue): Spend a reveal token to reveal cards with a particular color or rank. Revealing a color reveals all cards of that color in partner's hand. Revealing a rank reveals all cards with that rank in partner's hand. The game starts with 8 reveal tokens. If no token left, no more reveals can be given. 
                2. Discard: Discard a card to regain a reveal token and draw a new card. 
                3. Play a Card: If a card played follows sequence in its color stack, it succeeds. Success of rank 5 card in any stack gives an additional reveal token. Failure discards the card, and loses a life. Playing a card you are unsure about is risky as it costs a life and you have only 3 lives. Before playing a card make sure that it's the next card in the sequence for that stack.
        ***The game ends when:***
                - All five stacks are completed. 25 Points. 
                - Three lives have been lost. 0 Points no matter how many cards have been placed in the stack. 
                - After the last card from the deck is drawn and each player has had a final turn. Sum total of the top card ranks of each color stack. 
        

GAME STATE:
- Score: 0/25
- Deck Remaining: 40 cards
- Hint Tokens: 5/8


STRATEGIC PRIORITIES:
1. SAFETY FIRST: Never play a card unless you're certain it's playable
2. INFORMATION: Give hints that provide maximum useful information
3. EFFICIENCY: Only discard when necessary (low on hints) or when certain a card is useless
4. CRITICAL CARDS: Be extremely careful with 5s and unique cards visible in teammates' hands

DECISION FRAMEWORK:
- If you have certain knowledge a card is playable → PLAY it
- If hints available and teammate has playable card → Give helpful HINT
- If hints needed and you're certain a card is useless → DISCARD it
- Otherwise → Give a hint or discard safest card (oldest/leftmost with least info)

RULE: If you choose PLAY or DISCARD, "slot" MUST be one of the valid slots shown.
RULE: If you choose a hint, "teammate" MUST be one of: {teammate_a}, {teammate_b}.
If you choose anything invalid, you lose the game.

SAFE DISCARD HEURISTIC:
- If any of your cards are guaranteed dead → discard the leftmost dead card.
- If none dead: discard your oldest card that is most likely unplayable
  (slot with the largest number of remaining possibilities).
- NEVER discard a 5 unless it is confirmed dead.
